## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

As the core developer of this project, I handled both the **technical implementation** (backend, API design, model deployment) and **non-technical responsibilities** (documentation, team coordination, presentation preparation). More on this is available in the [Contributions.md](Contributions.md) file.
